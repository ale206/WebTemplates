To run:

1. yarn install
2. gulp 

You can rename the Get Started button to Login and use it for the Login/Logout

I need to convert this template to React and make the login/logout with the React code present in the other template.
This template still need to use yarn and gulo, and publish everything in the folder `dist`.
